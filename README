Dionysus is a very, very basic x86 kernel, and that is all it
aims to be. A simple yet functional (still working on that part)
kernel licensed under the GNU GPL. It is based rather heavily 
(for the time being) on theJames Molloy tutorial kernel available 
at <http://www.jamesmolloy.co.uk/tutorial_html/index.html>, but it's
already been significantly modified, and it is planned to be further
expanded in the future.

Dionysus is licensed under the GNU GPL. See COPYING for details.
