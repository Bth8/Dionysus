Practically everything. Very little's actually been implemented.

Immediate concerns:
Some kind of PCI registration. IDE would be the first, easiest part.

Finish blockdev rewrite.

Test shit

Rewrite other filesystems.

FAT32 needs to be finished. It would be nice if we could get EXT2, too.

User input sanitization.

Waiting.

Processes need to have children and parents.

IPC would be nice.

Need an init program.

Need a shell.

Work needs to be done on improving hard disk operations. Need to be able to
write to ATAPI, need to implement DMA, etc.

Race conditions need to be brought into consideration.

Improvements with ELF. Relocatable code, dynamic linking, etc.

Modules, which goes hand in hand with relocatable code.

More sophisticated memory management.

Page swapping, but we need good disk access first.

Later, other features such as USB support and the like may be implemented, but
we'll cross those bridges when we get to them.
