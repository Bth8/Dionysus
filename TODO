Practically everything. Very little's actually been implemented.

Immediate concerns:
Further work on process switching and management.

Work needs to be done on improving hard disk operations. Need to be able to
write to ATAPI, need to implement DMA, etc.

Serious overhaul on the whole memory allocation thing needs to take place. Oh my god it's bad.

Race conditions need to be brought into consideration, and error reporting
needs to consist of something more than just returning -1.

FAT32 needs to be finished. It would be nice if we could get EXT2, too.

Loading ELFs and perhaps other executable formats.

Later, other features such as USB support and the like may be implemented, but
we'll cross those bridges when we get to them.
