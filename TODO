Practically everything. Very little's actually been implemented.

Immediate concerns:
Processes need to have children and parents.

IPC would be nice.

Need an init program.

Need a shell.

Work needs to be done on improving hard disk operations. Need to be able to
write to ATAPI, need to implement DMA, etc.

Race conditions need to be brought into consideration.

Better error reporting.

FAT32 needs to be finished. It would be nice if we could get EXT2, too.

Improvements with ELF. Relocatable code, dynamic linking, etc.

Modules, which goes hand in hand with relocatable code.

Later, other features such as USB support and the like may be implemented, but
we'll cross those bridges when we get to them.
