Practically everything. Very little's actually been implemented.

Immediate concerns:

Finish IDE

FAT32 needs to be finished. It would be nice if we could get EXT2, too.

User input sanitization.

IPC would be nice. Signals especially.

Need an init program.

Need a shell.

Race conditions need to be checked rigorously.

Improvements with ELF. Relocatable code, dynamic linking, etc.

Modules, which goes hand in hand with relocatable code.

More sophisticated memory management.

Page swapping, but we need good disk access first.

Later, other features such as USB support and the like may be implemented, but
we'll cross those bridges when we get to them.
