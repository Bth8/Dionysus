Practically everything. Very little's actually been implemented.

Immediate concerns:
Further work on process switching and management.

Work needs to be done on improving hard disk operations. Need to be able to
write to ATAPI, need to implement DMA, etc.

The VFS needs eventual improvement, though it works alright for now.

The device management system needs expansion. A lot of it.

Some actual filesystems need to be implemented, but that probably needs to wait
until there are usable devices on top of which they can be built.

Loading ELFs and perhaps other executable formats.

Later, other features such as USB support and the like may be implemented, but
we'll cross those bridges when we get to them.
