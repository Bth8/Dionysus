Practically everything. Very little's actually been implemented.
Immediate concerns include fixing the multitasking system. As it
stands, processes are switched every 4 PIT fires, but forking
seems to disable the PIT (and interrupts of all kinds). Then, work
needs to be done to implement reading/writing from/to the hard disk.
Logically following would be some kind of filesystem support, such as
ext2 and 3, and loading ELFs and perhaps other executable formats.
Later, other features such as USB support and the like may be 
implemented, but we'll cross those bridges when we get to them.
