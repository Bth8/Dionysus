Practically everything. Very little's actually been implemented.

Immediate concerns:
Further work on process switching and management.

Work needs to be done to implement reading/writing from/to the hard disk.

Logically following would be some kind of filesystem support, such as
ext2 and 3.

Loading ELFs and perhaps other executable formats.

Later, other features such as USB support and the like may be 
implemented, but we'll cross those bridges when we get to them.
