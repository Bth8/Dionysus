Practically everything. Very little's actually been implemented.

Immediate concerns:
Further work on process switching and management.

Work needs to be done on improving hard disk operations. Need to be able to
write to ATAPI, need to implement DMA, etc.

A VFS of some description needs to be built.

Logically following would be some kind of filesystem support, such as ext2 and
ext3.

Possibly awful idea: Assemble the previous three ideas separately and throw it
all together... somehow.

Loading ELFs and perhaps other executable formats.

Later, other features such as USB support and the like may be implemented, but
we'll cross those bridges when we get to them.
